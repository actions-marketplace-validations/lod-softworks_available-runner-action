# PRD: GitHub Actions Runner Fallback

## Overview

Runner Fallback is a GitHub Action that automatically determines whether a preferred self-hosted runner is available and, if not, transparently falls back to a configurable GitHub-hosted runner.

The action is designed to be used as a lightweight dependency in GitHub Actions workflows and reusable workflows, allowing organizations to prioritize on-premises infrastructure while maintaining reliable CI/CD execution.

---

# Problem Statement

GitHub Actions does not natively support runner failover.

When a workflow specifies:

```yaml
runs-on: [self-hosted, my-runner]
```

and no matching runner is available, the job remains queued indefinitely.

Organizations commonly operate a mix of:

- Self-hosted runners
- GitHub-hosted runners

They need workflows that:

1. Prefer self-hosted infrastructure.
2. Continue running when self-hosted infrastructure is unavailable.
3. Require minimal workflow complexity.
4. Can be standardized across repositories.

---

# Goals

## Primary Goals

- Detect availability of self-hosted runners.
- Return a valid `runs-on` value.
- Support fallback to GitHub-hosted runners.
- Work with repository-level, organization-level, and enterprise-level runners.
- Support custom runner labels.
- Be usable in reusable workflows.
- Require no external infrastructure.

## Secondary Goals

- Support multiple preferred runner labels.
- Support multiple fallback runners.
- Expose diagnostics for troubleshooting.
- Provide marketplace-ready documentation.

---

# Non-Goals

- Scheduling jobs.
- Reserving runners.
- Load balancing.
- Queue management.
- Auto-scaling runner infrastructure.
- Executing jobs directly.

The action only determines which runner should be used.

# User Stories

## Story 1

As a developer,

I want my workflow to use my on-prem runner when available,

so that builds run on my own infrastructure.

## Story 2

As a developer,

I want builds to automatically use GitHub-hosted runners when my on-prem runner is offline,

so that deployments are never blocked.

## Story 3

As a platform engineer,

I want one standard action that all repositories can use,

so that runner selection logic is centralized.

---

# Example Usage

## Basic

```yaml
jobs:
  select-runner:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      runner: ${{ steps.runner.outputs.runner }}
    steps:
      - id: runner
        uses: org/runner-fallback-action@v1

  build:
    needs: select-runner
    runs-on: ${{ fromJSON(needs.select-runner.outputs.runner) }}

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: dotnet build
```

---

## Custom Labels

```yaml
- uses: org/runner-fallback-action@v1
  id: runner
  with:
    preferred-labels: |
      self-hosted
      windows
      build-server
```

---

## Custom Fallback

```yaml
- uses: org/runner-fallback-action@v1
  id: runner
  with:
    fallback-runner: windows-latest
```

---

# Functional Requirements

## FR-1 Detect Runner Availability

The action shall query the GitHub Actions API for available runners.

Supported scopes:

- Repository
- Organization
- Enterprise (future)

---

## FR-2 Label Matching

The action shall identify runners matching all supplied labels.

Example:

```yaml
preferred-labels:
  - self-hosted
  - windows
  - build-server
```

A runner must contain every label to qualify.

---

## FR-3 Online Check

The action shall only consider runners where:

```text
status = online
```

---

## FR-4 Idle Check

By default the action shall only consider runners where:

```text
busy = false
```

---

## FR-5 Fallback Runner

If no matching runner exists, the action shall return the configured fallback runner.

Default:

```text
ubuntu-latest
```

---

## FR-6 Outputs

### Output: runner

Type:

```yaml
string
```

Examples:

```json
["self-hosted","windows","build-server"]
```

or

```json
"ubuntu-latest"
```

---

### Output: selected_type

Values:

```text
self-hosted
github-hosted
```

---

### Output: diagnostics

Human-readable explanation.

Example:

```text
No online runner found matching labels:
[self-hosted, windows, build-server]

Using fallback:
ubuntu-latest
```

---

# Inputs

## preferred-labels

Type:

```yaml
multiline string
```

Default:

```text
self-hosted
```

---

## fallback-runner

Type:

```yaml
string
```

Default:

```text
ubuntu-latest
```

---

## require-idle

Type:

```yaml
boolean
```

Default:

```text
true
```

---

## fail-if-no-runner

Type:

```yaml
boolean
```

Default:

```text
false
```

If enabled:

- Do not use fallback.
- Fail action immediately.

# Technical Design

## Architecture

```text
Workflow
    |
    V
Runner Fallback Action
    |
    V
GitHub REST API
    |
    V
Runner List
    |
    +--> Matching Runner Found
    |         |
    |         V
    |   Return Labels
    |
    +--> No Match
              |
              V
      Return Fallback Runner
```

## API Endpoints

Repository scope:

```http
GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/runners
```

Organization scope:

```http
GET /orgs/{org}/actions/runners
```

---

# Security

## Permissions

Required:

```yaml
permissions:
  actions: read
```

No write permissions required.

No secrets required.

---

# Error Handling

## API Failure

If GitHub API cannot be reached:

Behavior:

```text
Use fallback runner.
```

Output diagnostics should indicate the API failure.

---

## Invalid Labels

If preferred labels are empty:

Behavior:

```text
Fail action.
```

---

## Invalid Fallback

If fallback runner is empty:

Behavior:

```text
Use ubuntu-latest.
```

---

# Logging

Action logs should include:

```text
Preferred Labels:
[self-hosted, windows]

Matching Runners:
2

Available Runners:
1

Selected:
self-hosted
```

or

```text
Preferred Labels:
[self-hosted, windows]

Matching Runners:
0

Selected:
ubuntu-latest
```

---

# Success Criteria

The action is considered successful when:

- Self-hosted runner is selected when available.
- Fallback runner is selected when unavailable.
- No workflow remains indefinitely queued waiting for a missing runner.
- The action works identically across repositories.
- Configuration requires fewer than 10 lines of workflow YAML.

---

# Future Enhancements

## Priority-Based Fallback Chain

```yaml
fallback-runners:
  - self-hosted-linux
  - ubuntu-latest
  - windows-latest
```

---

## Runner Group Support

```yaml
runner-group: production
```

---

## Organization Policy Mode

Centralized configuration for all repositories.

---

## Metrics

Expose telemetry outputs:

```yaml
runner_found: true
runner_name: build-server-01
runner_busy: false
selection_duration_ms: 120
```
